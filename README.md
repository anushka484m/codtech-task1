Project Overview: Inventory Management System
1. Project Objective
The Inventory Management System (IMS) aims to streamline inventory management tasks by providing a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting products. It also tracks inventory levels, generates reports, and ensures data integrity through validation and user authentication.

2. Key Features
User Authentication: Secure login and access control to manage different user roles.
Product Management:
Add: Add new products with details such as name, quantity, and price.
Edit: Modify existing product details.
Delete: Remove products from inventory.
Inventory Tracking: Monitor current inventory levels and alert when stock is low.
Reports Generation:
Low-Stock Alerts: Generate alerts for products with stock below a specified threshold.
Sales Summaries: Optionally, provide summaries of sales data.
Data Validation: Ensure data entered is correct and within acceptable ranges.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): A user-friendly interface using Tkinter for ease of use.
3. High-Level Architecture
The system can be divided into several key components:

Frontend (GUI)

Tkinter: A library for creating the graphical user interface.
Backend

Data Storage: JSON file or a lightweight database (SQLite) to store product information.
Business Logic: Functions to manage product operations and generate reports.
User Authentication: Mechanism to handle user login and access control.
Data Handling

Data Loading: Read data from the storage (JSON/SQLite).
Data Saving: Write updates to the storage.
Data Validation: Ensure correct and logical data input.
4. Technical Details
Programming Language: Python
GUI Library: Tkinter
Data Storage: JSON file or SQLite database
Libraries:
tkinter for the GUI
json for data handling (if using JSON)
sqlite3 for SQLite database (if using SQLite)
5. Components Breakdown
